Compilation Instructions for KCheckGMail (KDE4 version)

1.
Extract the downloaded tarball thus:
	tar xjf kcheckgmail-x.y.z.tar.bz2

Obviously you must replace x.y.z with the version of KCheckGMail you have
downloaded, eg:
	tar xjf kcheckgmail-0.6.0.tar.bz2

2.
Change into the directory that was extracted from the tarball, it should have
the form kcheckgmail-x.y.z, eg:

	cd kcheckgmail-0.6.0

3.
Create a build directory to not pollute the sources:

	mkdir kcheckgmail-x.y.z-build
	cd kcheckgmail-x.y.z-build

eg:

	mkdir kcheckgmail-0.6.0-build
	cd kcheckgmail-0.6.0-build

4.
If you are compiling an development version, please consider compiling with
debug enabled:
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull

5.
If you want to install it:
	sudo make install
