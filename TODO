Use kdewallet to store/retrieve the password...

Write a flex parser for the javascript returned from google. It will be
possible to use this data to differentiate messages when an email arrives at
the same time an email is read...

It would be nice, although not sure how possible at this stage, to have a
KIO slave representation of gmail. Read your Gmail messages from konq?

Should the configuration dialog be displayed when the username/password is
empty?

user defined icon for the systray


like how about selecting a contact from KCheckGmail and have it launch the
browser with a gmail compose message page showing?


One suggestion I have is to allow different notifications based on the gmail
label an incoming email gets; that way a different tune could be played
depending on who sent you an email. I don't know if the gmail protocols provide
the label info, but I think this would be helpful.
