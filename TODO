It would be nice, although not sure how possible at this stage, to have a
KIO slave representation of gmail. Read your Gmail messages from konq?

user defined icon for the systray


like how about selecting a contact from KCheckGmail and have it launch the
browser with a gmail compose message page showing?


One suggestion I have is to allow different notifications based on the gmail
label an incoming email gets; that way a different tune could be played
depending on who sent you an email. I don't know if the gmail protocols provide
the label info, but I think this would be helpful.
