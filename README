See the INSTALL file for information on how to install KCheckGmail.


Using KCheckGmail

The first time you use KCheckGmail, right-click and open the configuration
dialog. Enter your username, password and the checking interval, and click ok.
Assuming your username/password is correct, you will either get a standard
google icon (meaning, 0 new messages) or a faded out icon with your new message
count. A single left click on the icon will open Gmail in KDEs default browser.
